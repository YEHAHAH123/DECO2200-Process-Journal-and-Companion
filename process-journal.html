                <p>Our group is doing food delivery. According to the research we did and the feedback we got, we found that safety is the major problem in our concept. Firstly, the food may be taken by others because drone may not sure whether is the consumer. Secondly, the food may not be fresh when the consumer cannot take their food on time. Hence, we came up with an idea which adding two pick-up options. One is “pick up by themselves” and another one is “pick up on locker”. Users are able to choose one of the options they like when they finished their payment.</p>

                <p>In the beginning, in order to understand the feasibility and popularity of drone food delivery, I searched a lot of background information about food delivery. I found that food delivery is very popular now. In Australia, revenue in the Online Food Delivery segment amounts to US$1,052m in 2018. (statista). Moreover, I also searched for the existing products of drone delivery, I found that some companies are testing drone delivery now, such as ELEME and Foodpanda. </p>

I also found that drone can deliver the food to the consumer’s door, such as ANYmal.</p>

                <p>According to the feedback, the major problem of our group is safety. Thus, we were looking for the solutions for it. For avoiding others pick up the food, we were thinking of putting a lock in our drone delivery box and users can only open the delivery box when they entering the correct password. After we got the feedback from our friends and tutors, most of them claim that entering password may be dangerous for users because they need to come close to the drone and enter the correct password. We also feel that entering the password is inconvenient for users. As a result, we changed the idea of entering the password to scanning QR code. For the QR code, one of our members suggested that every consumer can have their own code, it can avoid consumer scan the wrong QR code. However, we were concerned that the QR code can be stolen easily because the QR code of every consumer is fixed. Therefore, we still make our QR code differently in each payment.</p>

                <p>For the locker solution, we spent a lot of time to find it. In the beginning, we were thinking of leaving the delivery in reception, users need to use the password they got to pick up their food in reception. However, we found that this solution is impossible for the people who live in a house or a unity because they do not have reception. As a result, we passed this idea. In the process of thinking another solution, one of our members found a post office locker on the street and it reminds her of Hive box locker. These lockers are located on the community, the parcels will be put inside the locker and people can pick up their parcels whenever they want. These ideas inspire us of the idea of the locker.</p>

                <p>After that, we started to draw our paper prototype. When we finished the prototype, we put them in Pop and did some user testing and we get some feedback. For the pick-up from drone method, most users feel that entering the password on the drone screen is dangerous because the propeller of the drone may hurt people and it also make people feel annoying when people enter the wrong password. For locker, most users claim that it is inconvenient to the people who are staying at home need to go downstairs to pick up. According to the feedback, we decided to combine these two concepts and change the password code to QR code. For our final paper prototype, we drew the prototype according to the process of ordering food.</p>

                <p> Firstly, users should log in to the APP, selecting the restaurant they like and the food they want. After that, they will proceed to the payment page. In this page, they are able to select the pick-up method. When they finished their payment, users can track their order. Our tracking page is special and different to other tracking pages, which you can see the real-time tracking and normal tracking at the same time. There is a button in the middle and you can drag it up and down to see more of the tracking way you like. When the food arrived, there is a notification to inform you and you have to slide it to close. After you slide the notification, there is a page for you to change your pick-up option, after you confirmed, your order and the QR code will be shown and you can pick up your food. After you pick up your food, you can rate the food and the drone. After we did our final prototype, we also put it into Pop and did some user testing. According to the feedback we received from our friends and some experts, they claim that it is dangerous for people to go close to the drone because the propeller of the drone may hurt people. We determined to have the food go to the consumer rather than consumer take the food from the drone delivery box directly. Thus, when consumer scanned their QR code, the drone will open their delivery box automatically, then there is a slideway coming out of the box and the food will slide down the slideway. Moreover, there is a baffle at the end of the slideway so the food will not drop down.</p>

                <p>In the end, we started our high-fidelity prototype based on our wireframe. Before we did our high-fidelity prototype, we discussed for the colour and typeface we were going to use. We found the pictures we used when we were making the prototype. We also made some improvement in our high-fidelity prototype. In the tracking page, our team made an ordering detail instead of real-time tracking and we narrow the real-time tracking to a small rectangle in the left-bottom part on the map. </p>

              <p>Moreover, in our high-fidelity prototype, we incorporate the order list and pick-up QR code in the same page, which user will be able to change how they want to pick up the food anytime. They can also check their order details and the location of the drone at the same time.</p>
